      UM RLC / 5-bit SN / Correct use of sequence numbering.

with { UE in E-UTRA RRC_CONNECTED state }
ensure that {
   when { UE transmits the first PDU } 
     then { UE sets the sequence Number field equal to 0 }
            }

with { UE in E-UTRA RRC_CONNECTED state }
ensure that {
   when { UE transmits subsequent PDUs } 
        then { SN incremented by 1 for each PDU transmitted }
              }
              
              
with { UE in E-UTRA RRC_CONNECTED state and an UM RLC DRB is configured using 5 bit SN }
ensure that {
    when { UE transmits more than 32 PDUs }
     then { UE wraps the Sequence Number after transmitting the 32 PDU }
             }
 
 
with { UE in E-UTRA RRC_CONNECTED state and an UM RLC DRB is configured using 5 bit SN }
ensure that {
   when { more than 32 PDUs are sent to UE }
     then { UE accepts PDUs with SNs that wrap around every 32 PDU }
             }
